# 🎬 Movie Night AI

A bold, colorful movie‑recommendation app that learns your taste and tells you what to watch tonight — no more 40‑minute scroll. Rate a few films you've seen, and a **Taste‑DNA** engine builds a personalized, diverse list grounded in real movie data.

> **Status:** MVP 2. The recommendation engine now runs on a deterministic **Taste‑DNA** scorer with diversity buckets (the LLM only profiles + explains), every card shows IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes/Metacritic scores, and the UI has had a full design‑system + accessibility pass.

---

## ✨ Features

- **For You** — a **Taste‑DNA** engine, not just a prompt. Every movie is scored on 10 bipolar axes (fast‑paced ↔ slow‑burn, character ↔ plot‑driven, dark ↔ optimistic, …) to capture *why* you like films. A deterministic hybrid scorer ranks a real TMDB candidate pool; the LLM only writes the explanations.
  - **Diversity buckets** — picks are sorted into **Safe Picks · Hidden Gems · Expand Your Taste · Critically Acclaimed · Underseen Favorites · Wildcard**, with hard caps (no "10 Nolan movies"). Each card shows its bucket.
  - **Smart anchors** — "Inspired by *Inception*" is the nearest film to the pick *by your Taste DNA*.
  - **Moods** (Cozy · Mind‑bender · Date night · Adrenaline) + **Taste × genre** chips
  - **"Your taste" strip** — your inferred DNA traits, plus top genres/people/themes
  - **"Not interested"** (with Undo) and a **streaming filter** to steer + scope picks
- **Scores everywhere** — IMDb, 🍅 Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic on every card and in the modal (OMDb, cached).
- **Discover** — a **poster‑forward grid**, sort + filter drawer (genre, decade, rating, runtime, streaming provider), title search with debounce, actor/director search, infinite scroll, and shareable URL‑encoded filters.
- **Watchlist** — built to answer *"what do I watch tonight?"*: **sort** (recently added · shortest runtime · highest rated · …), a **📺 "on my services"** filter that shows only what's streamable on your Netflix/Disney+/…, **runtime** filters, provider badges + runtime on each card, and a **🎲 Surprise me** button. Plus Up Next / Watched tabs, post‑watch ratings, remove with Undo, and a read‑only **Share** page.
- **Ratings** — manage everything you've rated; these power the recommendations.
- **Taste DNA page** — a radar of your 10 taste axes (slow‑burn ↔ fast, cerebral ↔ emotional, …) with per‑axis confidence, plus the genres, people, and themes that shape your picks. Makes the engine's model of you visible.
- **Movie modal** — backdrop, cast, **clickable** streaming providers (deep‑link straight to Netflix/Disney+/…), trailer, and rate/watchlist actions.
- **Learns from your ratings** — a linear **ranker is trained on your feedback** (`backend/train.py`) and only ships if it beats the previous scorer on an offline eval (time‑split, NDCG/Pearson). Ranking stays fully deterministic; the LLM never ranks.
- **Self‑measuring** — every recommendation logs an impression + predicted score; a `GET /analytics` endpoint reports CTR, watchlist conversion, acceptance, rating‑prediction accuracy, novelty, and diversity.
- **Settings** — Dark/Light theme, your default streaming services, and a "Not interested" manager (dismissed picks resurface after ~90 days, or restore them instantly).
- **Power-user & accessible** — a **⌘K command palette** (jump to any movie/person), keyboard-navigable card grids, a stacking multi-undo toast queue, per-page titles, keyboard focus trap in dialogs, screen‑reader semantics, 44px touch targets, reduced‑motion support, WCAG‑contrast text.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- A free **[TMDB API key](https://developer.themoviedb.org)** and a free **[Groq API key](https://console.groq.com)**

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd movie-night-ai
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
# Backend keys (repo root)
cp .env.example .env
#   → edit .env and add your TMDB_API_KEY and GROQ_API_KEY

# Frontend (points at the backend)
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
```

### 3. Backend (run from the repo root)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The SQLite database (`movie_night.db`) is created automatically on first launch.

### 4. Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

### Or run both at once
```bash
./start.sh           # starts backend (:8000) and frontend (:3000), Ctrl+C stops both
```

### Tests
The backend has a deterministic unit suite (no network) in [`tests/unit/`](./tests/unit) covering the
Taste‑DNA math, the hybrid scorer, bucketing + diversity caps, the taste‑profile builder, and the
analytics metrics.
```bash
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
venv/bin/pytest                                  # run the suite
venv/bin/pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing   # with coverage
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Ranking is deterministic**, so recommendations never degrade — only the LLM‑written *explanations* and Taste‑DNA enrichment pause when Groq's ~100K tokens/day are exhausted (the picks fall back to template reasons and recover when the window rolls over). DNA sharpens over time as movies get LLM‑scored in small per‑request batches.
- **OMDb is optional**: free key at [omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) — **activate it via the email link** or it returns `Invalid API key!`. Without it, score badges simply hide. Scores are cached, so the 1000/day limit ≈ 1000 *new* movies/day.
- **CORS** is locked to `http://localhost:3000` in `backend/main.py` — update it when deploying.
- Internal design and QA notes live in [`Improvement_plans/`](./Improvement_plans).

## 🗺️ Roadmap (post‑MVP) 

- In‑app analytics dashboard (the `/analytics` data, visualized)
- LLM movie clustering into named taste clusters
- Decouple "rate" from "mark watched" (optional)
- "Not interested" management view + exclusion decay
- Multi‑item undo queue
- Deployment (Vercel + a hosted API)
